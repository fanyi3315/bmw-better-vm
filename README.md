Better reimplementation of my BEST2 Virtual Machine


This project is a reimplementation of my first VM which I wrote in Pascal. It can now successfully execute a broad amount of jobs. Please note that some opcodes are not implemented, as I have not stumbled upon them yet.

This VM was used as a backend for my dissasembler, which I also open sourced here.
