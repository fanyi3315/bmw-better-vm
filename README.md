Better reimplementation of my BEST2 Virtual Machine


This project is a reimplementation of my first VM which I wrote in Pascal. It can now successfully execute a broad amount of jobs. Please note that some opcodes are not implemented, as I have not stumbled upon them yet.

For (ongoing) documentation about the instruction set, please see my blog post: https://lpcvoid.com/blog/0005_best2_instructionset/index.html

This VM was used as a backend for my dissasembler, which I also open sourced here.
